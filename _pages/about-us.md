# The AutoRL.org Team

We are a group of researchers based at the Albert-Ludwigs University Freiburg and Leibniz University Hannover, two hubs for machine learning research in Germany.
Our research foci vary within RL, but all of us want to help make RL more efficient, more general and easier to apply. 
We're also a subset of [AutoML.org](https://www.automl.org/) where you can find more general information on AutoML as a whole. 

The current contributors to AutoRL.org are (in alphabetical order):

[André Biedenkapp](https://andrebiedenkapp.github.io/)  
[Theresa Eimer](https://theeimer.github.io/)
